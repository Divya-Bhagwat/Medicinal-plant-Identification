# Medicinal-plant-Identification
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify medicinal plants from images. By training on a dataset of plant images, the model achieves high accuracy in plant classification, aiding in efficient and accurate identification for educational and research purposes.

# Features
Accurate Identification: Identifies the name of medicinal plants from images using CNN.
User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to upload images and receive plant names as output.
High Performance: Optimized for accurate identification of plant species.

# Project Directory
training.py: Script for training and testing the CNN model.
app.py: FastAPI application file for hosting the web service.
requirements.txt: Lists required Python packages for the project.

# Output
Plant Name: Provides the name of the medicinal plant identified from the input image.
Model Accuracy: Displays the accuracy metrics of the trained model.
